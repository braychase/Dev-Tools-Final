            The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native
            to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short,
            rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.
            It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females
            and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups
            called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related
            females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together,
            preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone
            predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and
            have been known to hunt humans, the species typically does not
            actively seek out and prey on humans.

            The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas and shrublands. It is usually
            more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to
            being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period,
            the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia from Southeast Europe
            to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in
            sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been
            listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because
            populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since
            the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated
            protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully
            understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest
            causes for concern.

            One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture,
            the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings,
            on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature. Lions
            have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and
            have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens
            across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of
            lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred
            in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's
            historic and current range.
