            The caracal (Caracal caracal) (/ˈkærəkæl/), is a medium-sized wild
            cat native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and arid areas
            of Pakistan and northwestern India. It is characterised by a robust
            build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears, and long canine
            teeth. Its coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, while the ventral
            parts are lighter with small reddish markings. It reaches 40–50 cm
            (16–20 in) at the shoulder and weighs 8–19 kg (18–42 lb). It was
            first scientifically described by German naturalist Johann Christian
            Daniel von Schreber in 1776. Three subspecies are recognised.

            Typically nocturnal, the caracal is highly secretive and difficult
            to observe. It is territorial, and lives mainly alone or in pairs.
            The caracal is a carnivore that typically preys upon small mammals,
            birds, and rodents. It can leap higher than 3.0 m (10 ft) and catch
            birds in midair. It stalks its prey until it is within 5 m (16 ft)
            of it, after which it runs it down and kills its prey with a bite to
            the throat or to the back of the neck. Both sexes become sexually
            mature by the time they are one year old and breed throughout the
            year. Gestation lasts between two and three months, resulting in a
            litter of one to six kittens. Juveniles leave their mothers at the
            age of nine to ten months, though a few females stay back with their
            mothers. The average lifespan of captive caracals is nearly 16
            years.

            Caracals were tamed in Ancient Egypt and used for coursing in India and Persia.
