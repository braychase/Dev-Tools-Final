            The cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) is a large cat native to Africa and
            central Iran. It is the fastest land animal, estimated to be capable
            of running at 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph) with the fastest
            reliably recorded speeds being 93 and 98 km/h (58 and 61 mph), and
            as such has evolved specialized adaptations for speed, including a
            light build, long thin legs and a long tail. It typically reaches
            67–94 cm (26–37 in) at the shoulder, and the head-and-body length is
            between 1.1 and 1.5 m (3 ft 7 in and 4 ft 11 in). Adults weigh
            between 21 and 72 kg (46 and 159 lb). Its head is small and rounded,
            with a short snout and black tear-like facial streaks. The coat is
            typically tawny to creamy white or pale buff and is mostly covered
            with evenly spaced, solid black spots. Four subspecies are
            recognised.

            The cheetah lives in three main social groups: females and their
            cubs, male "coalitions", and solitary males. While females lead a
            nomadic life searching for prey in large home ranges, males are more
            sedentary and instead establish much smaller territories in areas
            with plentiful prey and access to females. The cheetah is active
            during the day, with peaks during dawn and dusk. It feeds on small-
            to medium-sized prey, mostly weighing under 40 kg (88 lb), and
            prefers medium-sized ungulates such as impala, springbok and
            Thomson's gazelles. The cheetah typically stalks its prey to within
            60–70 m (200–230 ft), charges towards it, trips it during the chase
            and bites its throat to suffocate it to death. It breeds throughout
            the year. After a gestation of nearly three months, a litter of
            typically three or four cubs is born. Cheetah cubs are highly
            vulnerable to predation by other large carnivores such as hyenas and
            lions. They are weaned at around four months and are independent by
            around 20 months of age.

            The cheetah occurs in a variety of habitats such as savannahs in the
            Serengeti, arid mountain ranges in the Sahara and hilly desert
            terrain in Iran. The cheetah is threatened by several factors such
            as habitat loss, conflict with humans, poaching and high
            susceptibility to diseases. Historically ranging throughout most of
            Sub-Saharan Africa and extending eastward into the Middle East and
            to central India, the cheetah is now distributed mainly in small,
            fragmented populations in central Iran and southern, eastern and
            northwestern Africa. In 2016, the global cheetah population was
            estimated at 7,100 individuals in the wild; it is listed as
            Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. In September 2022, they were
            reintroduced to India after being extinct in the country for 70
            years. In the past, cheetahs were tamed and trained for hunting
            ungulates. They have been widely depicted in art, literature,
            advertising, and animation.
